      <div class="fakeimg photo"></div><br>
      <p class="big-font">Hi Everyone,</p>
      <p class="big-font">Welcome to my very first website. This is where I try to practice my skills and give people an insight of what I've been learning and creating recently.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="colorful">My Story as a Self-Taught Developer</h2>
      <h5>I've got still a long way to go, but I'll keep going until it gets me to my dreams for the future...</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg codephoto"></div>
      <p>It all started with a dream and zero coding experience...</p>

      <p>I'm a graduate of English Language Teaching and I've been working as an English Teacher for 10 years now. My husband is Polish and we currently reside in Turkey. However, we've always had plans to move to Poland one day. </p>

      <p>As we decided to move for sure last year, we started to make a plan and searched job opportunities in Poland. After a long market search we came up with the conclusion that teaching wouldn't pay as much as we desired. Plus job seeking websites were full of  offers called "developer". Back then, we had almost no idea what a dev is and what they actually do. So we got really intrigued and started to search what all the fuss is about considering this job. Seeing the big gap in the market for this field, we knew what we had to do. </p>

      <p>Since we had no access to bootcamps around our place, we had to go for online courses. We started "completely" from ZERO (literally from how internet actually works), devoted our time and energy and came to the point of being able to use HTML, CSS, and JS efficiently. We had courses from <a href="https://www.udemy.com">UDEMY </a>(highly recommended), especially <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/">"The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery"</a> by the amazing instructor Andrei Neagoie (He's a Godsend) and practised coding with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3school</a> and <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a>. We stayed active on <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.discordapp.com">Discord</a>. In the meantime , we still worked as full time teachers and had some extra private lessons (just to give you an idea of how little time we had to learn). We used to wake up at 06.00 study for 2 hours, then go to work,come home after 17.00, have some private lessons, then study for another 2 hours. </p>

      <p>We motivated ourselves that this is the only way out if we really want to move and have a good life and job in the future. Our biggest advantage was to know English very well, so we had no problems accessing resources or finding solutions. </p>

  	  <p>I still call myself a beginner, I have a long way to go, but I'm so grateful that my life is moving on this path. IT world amazes me and I'm so happy to be coding :) </p>
